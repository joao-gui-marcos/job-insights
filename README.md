# Summary

In this project, I implemente analyses from a dataset about jobs. The implementation was incorporated into a web application developed with Flask (a very popular web framework in the Python community). Tests were written for the implementation of the data analysis.

The data was extracted from the Glassdoor website and obtained through Kaggle, a platform that provides datasets for data scientists.

Conditional and repetition structures.
Python built-in functions.
Exception handling.
